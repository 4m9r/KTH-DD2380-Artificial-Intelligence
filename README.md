## Search
Using minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to find the possible moves in a game of catching fish.

More information on how to set up the environment and run the code can be found in the search folder.
## HMM
Using several algorithms to tackle hidden Markov problems.

**HMM0** calculates the probability of the outcome of the next state given state probability, transformation probability matrix, and outcome probability matrix.

**HHM1** calculates the probability of an observation sequence happening given the model by utilizing a forward algorithm(alpha-pass)

**HHM2** finds the most likely sequence of the hidden states that results in a sequence of observation by utilizing the Viterbi algorithm

HMM3 estimates the model using forward-backward algorithm

## RL
Using epsilon-greedy algorithm and Q-learning, we find an optimal policy.

More information on how to set up the environment and run the code can be found in the search folder.
