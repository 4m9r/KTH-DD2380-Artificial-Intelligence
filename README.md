## Search
Using minimax algorithm with alpha-beta pruning to find the possible moves in a game of catching fish.

More information on how to set up the environment and run the code can be found in the search folder.
## HMM
Using several algorithms to tackle hidden Markov problems.

HMM0 calculates the probability of the outcome of the next state given state probability, transformation probability matrix, and outcome probability matrix.

HHM1 calculates the probability of an observation sequence happening given the model by utilizing a forward algorithm(alpha-pass)

HHM2 finds the most likely sequence of the hidden states that results in a sequence of observation by utilizing the Viterbi algorithm

HMM3 estimates the model using forward-backward algorithm

## RL
Using epsilon-greedy and algorithm Q-learning we find an optimal policy.

More information on how to set up the environment and run the code can be found in the search folder.
